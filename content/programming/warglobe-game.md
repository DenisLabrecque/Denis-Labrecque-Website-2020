Eventually, Warglobe is to become an independently developed, free-to-play game with online combat in ships, airplanes, and vehicles. If possible, players will command groups of vehicles as well as drive them, combining the action and speed of a first-person shooter with the tactics of a real-time strategy game. Nevertheless, this depends on all previous phases (prototype, mission-based, and online multiplayer) being completed first.
