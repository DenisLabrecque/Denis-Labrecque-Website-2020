I created this scene to challenge myself to represent nature. It taught me how to use software light, and how to texture natural elements like water to make a good-looking render. An asset software called Bridge helped speed the composition process, and the image was rendered from Blender.

This image represents a garden that is closed off and allows wading in a pond of clear water while enjoying the warm sun. The golden hour lighting and visible elements are meant to convey that story.

The garden itself is in a pseudo-Japanese style; most of the elements are from Quixel Megascans, with the bridge and wall being custom modeled.

The work process was focused on creating the realism and atmosphere desired, while using technical elements such as shaders to represent that carefully.

The final image is part of a complete simulated landscape in which the camera is situated.
