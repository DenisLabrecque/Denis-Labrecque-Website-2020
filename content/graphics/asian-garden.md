I created this scene to challenge myself to represent nature. It taught me how to use software light, and how to texture natural elements like water to make a good-looking render. An asset software called Bridge helped speed the composition process, and the image was rendered from Blender.

{{< image "Asian_Garden_1.png" "Early on, the details are blocked in, but the lighting needs work. The fireflies are from a non-denoised draft render in Cycles." >}}

{{< image "Asian_Garden_2.png" "Changing the HDRI, adding grass, and improving the textures adds quite a lot to the realism." >}}

{{< image "Asian_Garden_3.jpg" "Additional tests help determine the sun's brightness and angle." >}}

{{< image "Asian_Garden.jpg" "This image represents a garden that is closed off and allows wading in a pond of clear water while enjoying the warm sun. The golden hour lighting and visible elements are meant to convey that story." >}}

The work process was focused on creating the realism and atmosphere desired, while using technical elements such as shaders to represent that carefully. Therefore the final image is part of a complete simulated landscape in which the camera is situated. The garden itself is in a pseudo-Japanese style; most of the elements are from Quixel Megascans, with the bridge and wall being custom modeled.
