This advertising campaign is for an imaginary model aircraft meetup in Montreal. It supports the event’s design needs, and is meant to attract visitors. Because of its particular location, part of the campaign is bilingual.

## Apparel
This apparel is designed to be sold as a fundraiser at the event. It was first sketched out on paper, then made in Illustrator and mocked up in Photoshop.

## Stage Design
This multipurpose stage is meant for live scale modeling demonstrations and sponsor product highlights. It can also host an awards ceremony and prize displays at the end of the event.

The stage is configured so that foot traffic from kiosks can stand momentarily to watch the speaker without breaking the audience’s line of sight. Supplies would be provided so attendees could test sponsor products at the work tables: large projector screens above both catwalk sides show a zoomed-in view of the presenter so they can follow along.

The catwalk arrangement allows visitors to remain standing to listen to the speaker, while not disturbing those who sit looking at the large screens.
The graphics for these mockups were made in Illustrator, and the renders were made using Blender 3D.

## Mail Invitation
This invitation is to be sent to targeted club members. It contains a small plastic model gift to attract attention and build goodwill towards the event. This piece was designed in Illustrator, then printed, laminated, and assembled as a lightweight mailable box.

## Tickets
For this long weekend event, tickets are required on each separate day. Because they must be instantly recognizable, they are colored differently for each day. Made using Illustrator, this project taught me the details of designing a themed admission to a specific event.
