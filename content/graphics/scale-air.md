## Apparel
This apparel was created and branded for the Ad Design campaign of Scale Air, a model airplane show in Montreal. It is designed to be sold as a fundraiser at the event. It was first sketched out on paper, then made in Illustrator and mocked up in Photoshop.

## Stage Design
This multipurpose stage is meant for live scale modeling demonstrations and sponsor product highlights. It can also host an awards ceremony and prize displays at the end of the event.

The stage is configured so that foot traffic from kiosks can stand momentarily to watch the speaker without breaking the audienceâ€™s line of sight. Supplies would be provided so attendees could test sponsor products at the work tables: large projector screens above both catwalk sides show a zoomed-in view of the presenter so they can follow along.
The stage wings are functional as well, because they can serve as displays.

The catwalk arrangement allows visitors to remain standing to listen to the speaker, while not disturbing those who sit looking at the large screens.
The graphics for these mockups were made in Illustrator, and the renders were made using Blender 3D.
