Creating 3D models is a skill I developed personally during college. Using rendering engines taught me the complicated but fascinating process of elaborating geometry and shaders to replicate the real world, from painstakingly copying building plans to properly using assets.

Designed by architect Guy Peterson, Spenser House is a residence made in the Sarasota School of Architectureâ€™s signature style. Using plans, it was possible to recreate it in Blender 3D software. Vegetation and texture assets were then added to complete the scene.
