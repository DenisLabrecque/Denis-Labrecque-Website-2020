Two stone block towers support this house, giving it the feeling of floating above ground. The main living spaces are left open plan, with large windowed walls funneling views towards both the front and the back, helping maintain privacy. The windows are also placed to provide features at night, where they will glow brightly against the dark stone construction, enhancing the buildingâ€™s volume.

Requested spaces for this house were: a living area with kitchen, a balcony, and a central courtyard. The napkin drawing for this design suggested a tall sculptural tower, serving the dual purpose of reading nook and stair tower, and acting as a central supporting structure.

The colors requested were teal and black. Dark stone was chosen to satisfy this request and give the appearance of solidity. To further maintain unity, the stone blocks go through the interior as well as the exterior. The attached renders realistically portray what the edifice would feel like in the real world. Each took five hours to complete on average, light particles being individually raycast by the Cycles rendering engine.
