  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>When he was very young, Denis enjoyed drawing airplanes and rolling a miniature steam engine around to understand how the wheels paired together. Eventually, his curiosity grew towards graphics, piqued by a book explaining how to design websites. He has since been imagining user interfaces by creating small apps on the side, by working as a web designer, and by working as a programmer.</p>
  <p>One of Denis' designs has been printed over 100,000 times; his programming has also helped maintain websites with over 3 million yearly users. He hopes to continue being useful in improving software user experiences for his future organization.</p>

  <p>Because Denisâ€™ interests range from composing orchestral music to using 3D software, and building electronics to making scale models, your project likely interests him! If you want help, you are welcome to <a href="#contact">contact him</a>.<p>
