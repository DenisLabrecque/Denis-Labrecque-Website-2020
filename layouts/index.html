   // To animate an element, place the data-anim="<screnPos> <elementPos>" attribute on the element to animate.
   // Value "top top" means animate the element when the top of the screen crosses the top of the element.
   // Value "middle bottom" means animate the element when middle of the screen crosses the bottom of the element.
   // Before animation, the element will have a "not-animated" class, replaced by "animated" once the animation occurs.
   // Style appropriately in CSS with transitions to cause the animation before and after.
