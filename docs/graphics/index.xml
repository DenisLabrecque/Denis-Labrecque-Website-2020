      <description>I created this scene to challenge myself to represent nature. It taught me how to use software light, and how to texture natural elements like water to make a good-looking render. An asset software called Bridge helped speed the composition process, and the image was rendered from Blender.
This image represents a garden that is closed off and allows wading in a pond of clear water while enjoying the warm sun.</description>
