       <p>Eventually, Warglobe is to become an independently developed, free-to-play game with online combat in ships, airplanes, and vehicles.

  <h2 id="about-the-game">About the Game</h2>
<p>In the early 2000s, video games came in cereal boxes. 
An example of this is Battleship: Surface Thunder, a simple mission-based third-person shooter that put my child fingers in control of a battleship. I was hooked.</p>
<p>Since then, the distant idea of creating a game with air and naval combat has stuck. Unfortunately, many games today are based on a flat map, which is great for game engines, but not so great for players who want a larger area. Therefore, the concept of creating a game that is a true globe came to mind: when traveling in one direction, the player, instead of encountering the edge of the map, will circumnavigate the game world. This gives the additional benefit of reducing the player’s visibility based on the curvature of the earth. This is the idea for Warglobe—a digitally spherical map on which players can do battle without encountering map edge confines.
The advent of more warship games such as World of Warships, War Thunder, and Cold Water demonstrates a true public interest in this type of video game. This means that to distinguish itself, Warglobe must be both easy to play and sophisticated in its mechanics.
Just as the original battleship was mission-based, Warglobe will most likely implement missions in its prototype stage, so that a few players can test vehicle mechanics Afterwards, the goal will become implementing online player-versus-player battles, which is a more challenging development task. Once online battles are complete, monetization of premium vehicles will help make the project sustainable.</p>
<p>Currently, Warglobe is in early development, with such mechanics as factions, flight, flotation, gravitation, radar spotting and ranging, firing, and basic vehicle functionality implemented. Because an interface was not necessary for early development, whatever user graphics did ensue were somewhat haphazard, made for programming convenience rather than visual appeal. However, the time for an aesthetic interface has now come.</p>
<p>Eventually, Warglobe is to become an independently developed, free-to-play game with online combat in ships, airplanes, and vehicles. If possible, players will command groups of vehicles as well as drive them, combining the action and speed of a first-person shooter with the tactics of a real-time strategy game. Nevertheless, this depends on all previous phases (prototype, mission-based, and online multiplayer) being completed first.</p>
<p>This document is the product of the last two Christmas breaks in ideas and programming. Because Warglobe is still an indie game in development, whether it will be successful is yet to be proven.</p>
<h2 id="concept-assets">Concept Assets</h2>
<p>To allow for independent development, this game’s models are simple enough to produce rapidly without a heavy investment in texturing. Using a stylized look will brand the game and avoid its looking dated due to advances in rendering technology.

<h3 id="gomer">Gomer</h3>
<p>The <strong>Gomerag</strong> live in a fictional country known officially as the <strong>Allied State of Gomer</strong>. Their capital is <strong>Galic</strong>.</p>
<p>This faction’s inspiration is Gomer, son of Japheth. Gomer’s descendants, called Gomerites, eventually settled all the way from from western Europe to Turkey. In Spain, their region was Galicia; in France, it was Gaul; and in Turkey, it was known as Galacia.</p>
<p>The flag is inspired from the popular depiction of Gauls as fierce warriors with horned helmets. Incidentally, this is likely an ethnic cliché, because horns would be cumbersome to wear in battle. However, as bulls are common in Spanish and French cave paintings, the symbol is still meaningfully representative of Gauls.</p>

Historical Scythians inspire the imaginary Scyth, and their settling Ukraine is the inspiration for their capital name, Ukra.</p>

<p>One of Javan’s sons was Elishah, and his offspring were the Elysians. This inspired the imaginary capital Elys.</p>

<p>This faction’s inspiration is Tubal, son of Japheth. They were known variously as the Tabali, Thobelites, and later Iberes. They gave their name to many locations in their eastward migration, such as to the cities of Tbilisi 
and Tobolsk.</p>
<p>The flag’s left field represents the Caucasus mountains from which the Thobelites came. The zig-zag lines represent their many river crossings during their trek across the Russian plains.</p>

<p>The <strong>Meshchera</strong> live in a fictional country known officially as the <strong>International Bloc of Meshk</strong>. Meshk’s capital is called <strong>Meshkva</strong>.</p>
<p>This faction’s inspiration is Meshech, son of Japheth. Meshech gave his name Moscow and to the Meschera Lowland that surrounds it.
Because of its connection to Moscow, this flag is inspired from the Russian colors. It is a combination of the Romanov crest and the modern Russian triband.</p>

<p>The <strong>Thurani</strong> live in a fictional country known officially as the <strong>International Bloc of Thur</strong>. Thur’s capital is also called <strong>Thur</strong>.</p>
<p>This faction’s inspiration is Tiras, son of Japheth. Eventually, Tiras’ sons became known as Thracians; their fathered was revered as Thuras (or Thor), god of thunder.</p>
<p>Thur’s flag is inspired from the ancient Viking hammer called Mjölnir, or Thor’s hammer. This mythological Norse pattern symbolizes Thor, who is in reality the Norse ancestor Tiras.</p>

<p>This faction’s inspiration is Mizraim, son of Ham. The Mizraim settled Egypt, and to this day Misr is a synonym for Egypt (as in Banque Misr, for bank of Egypt).</p>
<p>The flag takes cues from Egyptian art, which often features scarabs, oustretched wings, bold colors, and checkered borders.</p>

<p>The flag’s bird symbol is from a Jiroft culture bracelet. Because Jiroft culture is a Bronze Age people that left behind artifacts in central Iran, it is an example of what ancient Elamite art may have looked like.</p>

The Chaldeans have inspired the capital’s fictional name, Chalda.

<h3 id="madesh">Madesh</h3>

<p>This faction’s inspiration is Madai, son of Japheth. Madai’s descendants were known as Medes. Later, they would coalesce with the Persians, settling as far as India.</p>

<h3 id="peleset">Peleset</h3>
<p>The <strong>Pelesim</strong> live in a fictional country known officially as the <strong>Independent Faction of Peleset</strong>. The capital of Peleset is <strong>Jebussa</strong>.</p>
<p>This faction’s inspiration is Canaan, son of Ham; some of Canaan’s descendants were the Philistim, or Philistines, who settled across the Mediterranean coast, in what is commonly known today as Palestine.</p>
<p>From this Canaanite connection comes the capital name Jebussa, which in history was Jebus (later renamed Jerusalem), which remains a significant city to this day. The flag contains wave-like elements to commemorate the Philistine’s Mediterranean origins.</p>
