       </header>
       
       <p>Eventually, Warglobe is to become an independently developed, free-to-play game with online combat in ships, airplanes, and vehicles. If possible, players will command groups of vehicles as well as drive them, combining the action and speed of a first-person shooter with the tactics of a real-time strategy game. Nevertheless, this depends on all previous phases (prototype, mission-based, and online multiplayer) being completed first.</p>

    <h2 id="about-the-game">About the Game</h2>
<p>In the early 2000s, video games came in cereal boxes. 
An example of this is Battleship: Surface Thunder, a simple mission-based third-person shooter that put my child fingers in control of a battleship. I was hooked.</p>
<p>Since then, the distant idea of creating a game with air and naval combat has stuck. Unfortunately, many games today are based on a flat map, which is great for game engines, but not so great for players who want a larger area. Therefore, the concept of creating a game that is a true globe came to mind: when traveling in one direction, the player, instead of encountering the edge of the map, will circumnavigate the game world. This gives the additional benefit of reducing the player’s visibility based on the curvature of the earth. This is the idea for Warglobe—a digitally spherical map on which players can do battle without encountering map edge confines.
The advent of more warship games such as World of Warships, War Thunder, and Cold Water demonstrates a true public interest in this type of video game. This means that to distinguish itself, Warglobe must be both easy to play and sophisticated in its mechanics.
Just as the original battleship was mission-based, Warglobe will most likely implement missions in its prototype stage, so that a few players can test vehicle mechanics Afterwards, the goal will become implementing online player-versus-player battles, which is a more challenging development task. Once online battles are complete, monetization of premium vehicles will help make the project sustainable.</p>
<p>Currently, Warglobe is in early development, with such mechanics as factions, flight, flotation, gravitation, radar spotting and ranging, firing, and basic vehicle functionality implemented. Because an interface was not necessary for early development, whatever user graphics did ensue were somewhat haphazard, made for programming convenience rather than visual appeal. However, the time for an aesthetic interface has now come.</p>
<p>Eventually, Warglobe is to become an independently developed, free-to-play game with online combat in ships, airplanes, and vehicles. If possible, players will command groups of vehicles as well as drive them, combining the action and speed of a first-person shooter with the tactics of a real-time strategy game. Nevertheless, this depends on all previous phases (prototype, mission-based, and online multiplayer) being completed first.</p>
<p>This document is the product of the last two Christmas breaks in ideas and programming. Because Warglobe is still an indie game in development, whether it will be successful is yet to be proven.</p>
<h2 id="concept-assets">Concept Assets</h2>
<p>To allow for independent development, this game’s models are simple enough to produce rapidly without a heavy investment in texturing. Using a stylized look will brand the game and avoid its looking dated due to advances in rendering technology.

<h3 id="gomer">Gomer</h3>
<p>The <strong>Gomerag</strong> live in a fictional country known officially as the <strong>Allied State of Gomer</strong>. Their capital is <strong>Galic</strong>.</p>
<p>This faction’s inspiration is Gomer, son of Japheth. Gomer’s descendants, called Gomerites, eventually settled all the way from from western Europe to Turkey. In Spain, their region was Galicia; in France, it was Gaul; and in Turkey, it was known as Galacia.</p>
<p>The flag is inspired from the popular depiction of Gauls as fierce warriors with horned helmets. Incidentally, this is likely an ethnic cliché, because horns would be cumbersome to wear in battle. However, as bulls are common in Spanish and French cave paintings, the symbol is still meaningfully representative of Gauls.</p>

and Tobolsk.</p>
<p>The flag’s left field represents the Caucasus mountains from which the Thobelites came. The zig-zag lines represent their many river crossings during their trek across the Russian plains.</p>

<p>This faction’s inspiration is Meshech, son of Japheth. Meshech gave his name Moscow and to the Meschera Lowland that surrounds it.
Because of its connection to Moscow, this flag is inspired from the Russian colors. It is a combination of the Romanov crest and the modern Russian triband.</p>

<h3 id="asshuria">Asshuria</h3>
<p>The <strong>Asshur</strong> live in a country known officially as the <strong>Federal Coalition of Asshuria</strong>. Their capital is <strong>Ashkh</strong>.</p>
<p>This faction’s inspiration is Asshur, a son of Shem. Asshur gave rise to the empire of Assyira. Their flag’s cardinal symbol conveys the central location and importance of Assyria within Mesopotamia, and the two lines represent the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, between which Assyria was wedged.</p>

<p>This faction’s inspiration is Arphaxad, son of Shem. Arphaxad gave birth to the Chaldeans, Hebrews (through Eber), and Arabians (through Joktan). The Chaldeans have inspired the capital’s fictional name, Chalda. The Middle Eastern connection has inspired the flag: its colors are from similar Arabic flags; and the dagger is shaped as a janbiya, a type of curved knife originating from Yemen and Saudi Arabia.</p>
